<p>It would be difficult to think of <i>Mr. Punch’s</i>
prototype of the immortal drama as “in Society”;
but, however much our national jester may resemble
in facial detail the somewhat rude and impulsive
character from whom he took his name, he is in
all his instincts a gentleman. In other words, it
is just here that <span class="smcap">Punch</span> has differed from most
comic journals, being, if not absolutely from
the first number, certainly from its early days,
distinguished for refinement of taste and good
manners, not less than for its wit and humour.
“<span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> in Society” is indeed <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>
in his most congenial surroundings, as he has been above all
else the untiring, irrepressible satirist of the social world.</p>

<p>If an analysis were made of all the drawings which have
appeared in <span class="smcap">Punch</span> from 1841 to the present day, we venture to
think that those devoted to Society’s ways, its foibles, its follies,
would greatly outnumber the illustrations of any other phase of
life. And was not the entire career of one of <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch’s</span> most
celebrated artists devoted exclusively to social satire? The name
of George du Maurier is pre-eminent in the history of modern
humorous art. To an unerring instinct for character, shrewd
but never unkindly satire, he united a profound sense of beauty
which made his work unique and individual. It was thus that
to a vast public, of which only a very small proportion could be
expected to possess any art culture, Du Maurier’s work appealed
with irresistible force, his charming lightness of touch, his
gaiety, which came no doubt from his Gallic origins, rendering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
everything from his pencil a source of delight to the general
public, no less than to the students of draughtsmanship.</p>

<p>Du Maurier’s connection with <span class="smcap">Punch</span> began in 1860 and his
earliest work displayed very little of that wonderful grace to
which it attained before many years had passed, but Mr. Henry
James, discussing his art so long ago as 1883, said that “since
1868, <span class="smcap">Punch</span> has been, artistically speaking, George du Maurier,”
an opinion which would certainly be accepted in America, where
for a generation the cultured classes looked to Du Maurier, as
Mr. Spielman reminds us, “almost exclusively, not only for
English fashions in male and female attire, the <i>dernière mode</i> in
social etiquette, but for the truest reflection of English life and
character.”</p>

<p>When we consider that almost exclusively in the pages of
<span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> is the artistic life-work of Du Maurier contained,
we shall see how inexhaustible a treasury is there to be drawn
upon for such a collection as the present. We have thought
it wise, however, not to limit “<span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> in Society” to the
work of any one humorist, but have sought to present a collection
of Du Maurier’s best social satires in company with those
of many other artists who, in their individual ways, have also
depicted the humours of social life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Jack</span>,&mdash;I want
you to come down on
Monday and stay a couple
of days with me. My wife
will be delighted, as you can
help her with a children’s
party, and also play Pantaloon
in a little thing being
got up by the young people.
I will mount you on the
Tuesday with our Stag hounds,
as I know you are
fond of a day’s hunting.
No, don’t thank me, my dear chap&mdash;I shall be only
too glad if you will go, as the horse I am intending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
to put you on is a rank brute, and when he doesn’t
refuse his fences&mdash;which is a rare occurrence&mdash;he
invariably falls into them. However, you won’t
mind <i>that</i>, will you?</p>

<p>You will have to put up with real bachelor
accommodation, I am afraid, as the house is
crammed. The best I can do for you is a half
share of one of the attics. Our cook has left us,
all unexpectedly, so this places her room at our
disposal for two of you. The kitchen-maid is
doing her best to keep us from starving; but,
though she means well, I can hardly class her as a
<i>cordon bleu</i>.</p>

<p>Louise Dearlove, that pretty little girl you were
so sweet upon last season, is unable to come; but
her brother&mdash;the red-headed youth who was always
trying to pick a quarrel with you&mdash;will be here.</p>

<p>I am so short of horses that I fear I must ask
you to cab the four miles up from the station; but
I am sure you won’t mind taking the rough with
the smooth.</p>

<p>Yours ever,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Jostler</span>.</p>

<p>As the recipient of the above invitation, I ask
which is “the smooth”?</p>

you won’t guess who I am. See, the American
Banner and the Union Jack. I represent “Under
Two Flags.”</p>

<p><i>First Hostess.</i> Oh, how clever! But we shall
have Mr. Smith here presently, and he is sure to
come in something quite new.</p>

other! “Under Two Flags.” Eh?</p>

<p><i>First Hostess.</i> Wonderful! We shall have Mr.
Smith here by and by. He is sure to amuse us.</p>

<p><i>Third Lady (entering).</i> I promised to come and
here I am. The Star Spangled Banner and our
own Royal Standard. “Under Two Flags.”
There, isn’t it good?</p>

<p><i>First Hostess.</i> Quite too good! So pleased you
have come. We are waiting for Mr. Smith. He’s
sure to make us all laugh, as he’s <i>so</i> original!</p>

<p><i>Fourth Lady.</i> Up to my time! And I have
come as a well-known book. See, a dear little
American banner on one side of my head, and a
weeny, weeny Union Jack on the other. “Under
Two Flags.” I thought I would surprise you!</p>

<p><i>First Hostess.</i> I knew you would. Mr. Smith
is coming! He’s sure to be funny.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smith (entering).</i> Now you must guess. I
won’t take off my cloak until I have shown you
these two dolls. Here they are, soldiers of the
time of Louis XIV. And now you shall see me.

I represent, with the help of my companions,

<h3>THE LATEST THING IN CRIME</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>A Dialogue of the Present Day</i>)</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Mrs. Featherston’s Drawing-room. Mrs.
Thistledown discovered calling.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Thistledown</i> (<i>taking up a novel on a side-table</i>).
“The Romance of a Plumber,” by Paul
Poshley. My dear Flossie, you <i>don’t</i> mean to
tell me you read <i>that</i> man?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Featherston.</i> I haven’t had time to do
more than dip into it as yet. But why, Ida?
<i>Oughtn’t</i> I to read him?</p>

<p><i>Ida.</i> Well, from something Mr. Pinceney told
me the other day&mdash;but really it’s too bad to repeat
such things. One never knows, there <i>may</i> be
nothing in it.</p>

<p><i>Flossie.</i> Still, you might just as well <i>tell</i> me,
Ida! Of course I should never dream&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ida.</i> After all, I don’t suppose there’s any secret
about it. It seems, from what Mr. Pinceney says,
that this Mr. Poshley&mdash;you must <i>promise</i> not to say
I told you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Flossie.</i> Of course&mdash;of course. But do go on,
Ida. What <i>does</i> Mr. Poshley do?</p>

<p><i>Ida.</i> Well, it appears he <i>splits his infinitives</i>.</p>

<p><i>Flossie</i> (<i>horrified</i>). Oh, not <i>really</i>! But how
<i>cruel</i> of him! Why, I met him at the Dragnetts’
only last week, and he didn’t look at <i>all</i> that kind
of person!</p>

<p><i>Ida.</i> I’m afraid there’s no doubt about it. It’s
perfectly notorious. And of course any one who
once takes to <i>that</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Flossie.</i> Yes, indeed. <i>Quite</i> hopeless. At least,
I <i>suppose</i> so. Isn’t it?</p>

<p><i>Ida.</i> Mr. Pinceney seemed to think so.</p>

<p><i>Flossie.</i> How sad! But can’t anything be <i>done</i>,
Ida? Isn’t there any law to punish him? By the
bye, how <i>do</i> you split&mdash;what is it?&mdash;infinitudes?</p>

<p><i>Ida.</i> My dear, I thought you knew. I really
didn’t like to ask any questions.</p>

<p><i>Flossie.</i> Well, whatever it is, I shall tell Mudies
not to send me anything more of his. I <i>don’t</i> think
one ought to encourage such persons.</p>

<h3>SERVICE AND SOCIETY NEWS</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>According to Mr. Sheldon</i>)</p>

<p class="blockquote">[“The Rev. Charles M. Sheldon has just aroused the
wrath of the ladies of Topeka by his views on the servant-girl
problem. He advocated from the pulpit ‘the hired
girl’ should be treated as one of the family and cherished,
not chided.”&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i>]</p>

<p>Lord Doubleshire entertained a small party
of friends at his town house last evening. After
dinner the servants mingled freely with the guests,
and the Marchioness of Stoke Newington was
presented to the second stair-maid, Miss Elizabeth
Wilkins, whose acquaintance she made.</p>

<p>Among the smart “bridge” parties last week
must be numbered Mrs. Algey Bounceby’s. Her
butler, Thomas Scraggs, who paired for the first
rubber with the Duke of Dunkirk, is fast proving
his claim to be one of the finest exponents of this
fashionable card game.</p>

<p>We understand that the Countess of Crumbleton
has issued cards to a distinguished but select few
to meet her coachman, Mr. John Jenkins.</p>

<p>At the theatre the other evening, conspicuous
among a remarkably well-dressed set of people, we
noticed Lord Loughboro, the Hon. Misses Loughboro,
and the head gardener, Ezekiel Jilks. The
latter gentleman wore the famous silver Albert
watch-chain, a Christmas present, it is understood,
from Miss Gwendolen Loughboro, the bestowal of
which gift has aroused so much comment in
aristocratic and horticultural circles.</p>

<p>Half-a-dozen dissatisfied members of Brooks’s
club are talking of resigning if Lord Livewell’s
groom is not black-balled. He was of course put
up by Lord Livewell himself and seconded by his
uncle, Earl Gothepace. One or two rumours have
certainly reached us reflecting on the temperance
of Bob Whippet, the handsome groom. But for
the old-fashioned prejudices which evidently animate
the action of the discontented six, we have
nothing but the severest reproof.</p>

<p>Owing to the severe illness of Miss Madeline
Marrowby, the stall at the forthcoming Bazaar will
be taken by her maid Ellen Cripps. As previously
arranged, the stall-holders will be presented
individually to the Royal Visitors.</p>

<p>In the forthcoming golf competition, at Hoylake,
Miss Susan Bates, the scullery-maid to Hon. Miss
Fitzwinter, is looked on as a likely prize winner.
Her handicap playing has shown a wonderful improvement
lately, so much so that her considerate
mistress has given her permission to forego her
ordinary duties of washing up the dishes and filling
the coal scuttles, in order that she may get in
a good morning’s practice on the links.</p>

<p>Among the presentations for the next Drawing-room
we are glad to notice the name of Kate
Briggs, the pretty second parlour-maid of Lord
and Lady Wigmore. It will be remembered that
their head butler attended the last levée. A full
description of Miss Briggs’s presentation costume
appears elsewhere.</p>

<h3>“AWFUL” TASTE IN 1875!</h3>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Ball Room. Edwin leads out Angelina
as arranged earlier in the evening, to dance
a promised “square.” They walk through the
first figure. A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Edwin.</i> Been to the Academy, of course?</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> O yes. Been several times. So fond
of Miss Thompson’s picture, you know. I like the
group of the dying soldier and the boy laughing at
having killed a Frenchman, awfully. So awfully
clever, you know.</p>

<p><i>Edwin.</i> O awfully! The wounds are so awfully
true to nature, you know. Do <i>we</i> begin?</p>

<p><i>They walk through the second figure. A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Edwin.</i> Been to see Salvini?</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> Of course. Isn’t he awfully nice?
I think he is perfectly charming in <i>Othello</i>. His
face quite reminds me, in the Jealousy Scene, of
dear Mr. Irving in the last Act of <i>The Bells</i>. His
suicide at the end of the piece, you know, is really
quite too awfully clever. Isn’t it?</p>

<p><i>Edwin.</i> You mean the throat-cutting affair, eh?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
When he falls on his back and dies quivering, eh?
O yes, awfully clever. It’s our turn, I think.</p>

<p><i>They walk through the third figure. A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Edwin.</i> Read any novels lately?</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> Just read an awfully nice book, “The
Law and the Lady.” One of the heroes is a monstrosity
without legs, Miserrimus Dexter, don’t you
know. Awfully clever.</p>

<p><i>Edwin.</i> O yes. Read the book myself. Clever
notion, the idiotic man-woman, eh, wasn’t it?</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> O yes, awfully good. I think they
are waiting for us.</p>

<p><i>They walk through the fourth figure. Promenade.</i></p>

<p><i>Edwin.</i> Did you go to Stafford House to see
the coffins?</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> O yes, we all went&mdash;Mamma, Papa,
and the children, don’t you know. Met everybody
there. Such an awful crush.</p>

<p><i>Edwin.</i> Like the coffins?</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> O so much. They looked awfully
nice. So deliciously cool, don’t you know.</p>

<p><i>Edwin.</i> Cool! You like that kind of thing
cool, eh?</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> Yes, I think so.</p>

<p><i>Edwin.</i> Ah, then you must be against cremation?</p>

(<i>After consideration.</i>) Yes, I think so. Yes, I

<p>We are glad to be able to state that Lord Mount
Sorrel’s favourite monkey, which has been suffering
lately from phlebitis, is well on the way to recovery.
No further bulletins will be issued.</p>

<p>The report that Lady Agatha Fitzhunter’s pet
pony was confined to the stable with bronchitis is
grossly exaggerated. The pony merely complained
of being a little horse. The joke, of course,
like its maker, was a chestnut.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin Bradley’s French poodle is rapidly
re-covering. It is admitted on all hands, however,
that it was a remarkably close shave.</p>

<p>The alarming rumour that Lord Barndore’s
famous owl (which had been suffering from insomnia
lately) had committed suicide on Tuesday night, is
happily contradicted this morning. It appears that
the owl had merely left the house for a few hours
for a special purpose-to wit, to woo!</p>

<p>Lord Raspberry’s prize turkey, which a short
time ago had a painful operation performed on its
neck, was able to appear at dinner last night and
received a cordial welcome from those present.</p>

<p>The absurd tale that Lady Hopton Wood’s
pretty little Manx cat was suffering from diseased
liver has no foundation in fact. The liver was
perfectly good, and similar to that usually supplied.</p>

<h3>A DANCE DIALOGUE</h3>

<p>“A smartish affair this,” I said to the little
man with the pale-blue eyes, who leant disconsolately
against the wall.</p>

<p>He laughed nervously. I felt drawn to him,
somehow. He appeared to know no one, and I
knew very few intimately, and hadn’t succeeded
yet in discovering the host and hostess.</p>

<p>“But I should say,” I went on, drawing inspiration
from my new acquaintance’s sympathetic
attention, “I should say it cost our host Sir Tumnal
Tintz a pretty penny. The champagne is exactly
up to par, and no stint.”</p>

<p>“Really, I’m glad to hear you say so.”</p>

<p>“Reassuring, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>From our point of vantage we could command a
full view of the ball-room. The melody of the
waltz, the perfume, and the frou-frou of Parisian
and Viennese confections had lulled the little man
into a delicious reverie.</p>

<p>“There,” I said, “you see that old chap who looks
as if he had stolen the Eastern Hemisphere and
put it under his waistcoat&mdash;that explains the fizz!”</p>

<p>My friend looked exceedingly puzzled.</p>

<p>“That’s Gootzegog&mdash;the chap who supplied the
wine. Oh, everybody knows Sir Tumnal runs
things a bit above his income. Lady Tintz has
social ambitions. What’s the consequence? Bills
are paid by invitations to meet all the exclusive
and celebrated, instead of by coin of the realm.
Gootzegog accepted with pleasure&mdash;on the back
of a receipted bill for six dozen ‘bottles of the
boy.’”</p>

<p>“Really, this is exceedingly unpl&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Social sins,” I said. “You’ll know them all by
heart by and by. It’s only a question of time.
Now, you see that woman hop-waltzing. There,
just passed us, high-pitched voice, pearls&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is Mrs. Grinburger, known in Chatham
Street as Juliette &amp; Cie., swagger dressmakers,
where Lady Tintz can make up her betting-book,
and hedge&mdash;by patronising the Grinburger.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word!” in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Scandalous having to meet these people. And
that thin woman bare-ly clothed&mdash;ha! ha! excuse
my little quip.”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mdlle. Sembrach&mdash;bonnets; supplies the Tintz
girls with headgear, and is allowed to pass as a
friend of the family because she forgets to send in
the bill. Convenient, isn’t it? She looks like
making a match&mdash;or a breach of promise&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is incredible,” almost vociferated my little
friend, whose eyes I was evidently opening as to
the ways and means of a certain, or rather uncertain,
class of society. “It is incredible,” he said,
“that you should tell me all these scandalous tales
in the house where you are privileged&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Quite so, quite so,” I said, fearing I may have
wounded his sensibilities. “One only does this
sort of thing when the function is a fizzle. But
you appeared to know no one.”</p>

<p>“You appear to know everyone&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A good many. Come, let us have a stroll
round and try and find the host.”</p>

<p>The little man blinked nervously.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea what the Johnny’s like?”
I enquired.</p>

<p>“Exactly like me,” said the little man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> “I am

but wot had driven her home at the hunerthly hour

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">CHAPTER II.</span>&mdash;<i>The Helopemeant!</i></p>

<p>Seated in the Housekeeper’s own Room at the
Dook of Surrey’s lovely Manshun, playfoolly
patting his fatted calves, and surrounded by his
admiring cirkle, sat Charles, the ero of my Tale.
Charles was the idle of that large establishment.
They simply adored him. It was not only his
manly bewty, tho that mite have made many an
Apoller envy him. It was not only his nolledge
of the world, tho in that he was sooperior to
menny a Mimber of Parlyment from the Sister
Oil, but it was his style, his grace, his orty demeaner.
The Housekeeper paid him marked
attenshuns. The Ladies Maid supplyed him with
Sent for his ankerchers. The other Footmen
looked up to him as their moddel, and ewen the
sollem Butler treated him with respec, and sumtimes
with sumthink else as he liked even better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
The leading Gentlemen from other Doocal establishments
charfed him upon his success with the
Fare, ewen among the werry hiest of the Nobillerty,
and Charles bore it all with a good-natured larf
that showed off his ivory teeth to perfecshun. Of
course it was all in fun, as they said, and probberly
thort, till on this fatal ewening, the noose spread
like thunder, through the estonished world of
Fashun, that Charles had heloped with the
welthy, the middle-aged, but still bewtifool,
Marchioness of St. Bendigo.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span>&mdash;<i>The Dewell.</i></p>

<p>The pursoot was rapid and sucksessful, and the
Markiss’s challenge reyther disterbed the gilty
pair at their ellegant breakfast. But Charles
was as brave as he was fare, and, having hired his
fust Second for twenty-five francs, and made a few
other erangements, he met his hantigginest on the
dedly field on the follering day at the hunerthly
hour of six hay hem. Charles, with dedly haim,
fired in the hair! but the Markiss being bald, he
missed him. The Markiss’s haim was even more
dedly, for he, aperiently, shot his rival in his hart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
for he fell down quite flat on the new-mown hay,
and dishcullered it with his blud!</p>

<p>The Markiss rushed up, and gave him one
look of orror, and, throwing down a £1,000 pound
note, sed, “that for any one who brings him two,”
and, hurrying away to his Carridge, took the next
train for Lundon. Charles recovered hisself
emediately, and, pocketing the note, winked his
eye at the second second, and, giving him a
hundred-franc note for hisself, wiped away the
stains of the rouge and water, and returned to
breakfast with his gilty parrer-mour.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapter IV.</span>&mdash;<i>The End.</i></p>

<p>The poor Markiss was so horryfied at his
brillyant sucksess, that Charles’s sanguinery
corpse aunted his bed-side, and he died within a
month, a leetle munth, as <i>Amlet</i> says, of the dredful
ewent, and Charles married his Widder. But,
orful to relate, within a werry short time Charles
was a sorrowin’ Widderer, with a nincum of sum
£10,000 a year; and having purchased a Itallien
titel for a hundred and fifty pound, it is said as he
intends shortly to return to hold Hingland; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a><br /><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
as the lovely Countess of Belgravier is fortnetly
becum a Widder, and a yung one, it is thought
quite posserbel, by them as is behind the seens,
like myself, for instance, that before many more
munce is past and gone, there will be one lovely
Widder and one andsum Widderer less than there
is now; and we is all on us ankshushly looking
forred to the day wen the gallant Count der
Wennis shall lead his lovely Bride to the halter

<h3>SOME EMOTIONS BUT NO MORAL</h3>

<p><i>Lady Angleby</i> (<i>mother of pretty débutante</i>).
Really! It’s positively painful. It ought to be
stopped.</p>

<p><i>Elderly Countess</i> (<i>with no daughters</i>). Eh, what?
Tooth hurtin’? Have it out, my dear. Or try
mind healin’. It’s very expensive, but Susan
Southwater tells me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> Oh, Susan! She’s always got some
bee in her bonnet. Though how any self-respecting
bee <i>could</i>! But I wasn’t talking about teeth.
It’s this wretched paper. Listen to this. “One
of the prettiest <i>débutantes</i> I saw was Miss Nora
Angleby, whose mother, Lady Angleby, was wearing
nothing but a string of pearls&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> Have ’em up for libel, my dear. I
wouldn’t stand it.</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> “&mdash;nothing but a string of pearls
with her white frock, and looking so delightfully
young. Everyone was saying that they might be
sisters.” Isn’t it too silly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> H’m! I dunno. You do look youngish
sometimes. As for the frock&mdash;don’t you think it
was a <i>leetle</i> too&mdash;for the part, you know?</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> Oh, did you think so? It’s the
way they are cutting them this year for girls.
But don’t you think they ought to be pulled
up?</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> The frocks, my dear, or the dressmakers,
or the girls?</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> No, no, the editors. I’m in this
wretched rag week after week.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Thrope (also mother of pretty débutante).</i>
So am I. It’s a perfect scandal.</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> Are you? I don’t <i>see</i> your name anywhere.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> If you look&mdash;isn’t there an account of
the Hersham House Ball?</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> Oh, yes, here you are. “Mrs. Thrope,
who goes everywhere, was in great good looks and
her well-known magenta frock.” You’ll have to
get a new one, darling, after that. “She was
chaperoning her daughter, Miss Anne Thrope,
another <i>débutante</i>, who was quite the beauty of
the&mdash;&mdash;” Well, really! What can it matter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
anyone whether Anne’s a beauty or not, poor
darling!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> She did look rather sweet, didn’t she?</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> What? Oh, ah, yes. Quite pretty, I
thought. But to have it put in print like that for
any Dick, Tom, or Harry to read! It does away
with all the privacy of life.</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> Who <i>does</i> read it&mdash;besides you two?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Who? The suburbs, of course.
Susan tells me the circulation in Bayswater is
perfectly enormous. Of course <i>I</i> only get it to
read <i>her</i> things.</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> So do I. Not that they are worth
reading. They always seem to me to be so
<i>banale</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Yes, aren’t they? And so absolutely
without point.</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> What makes ’em print ’em, then?</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> Oh, money, of course. Her money.
It’s the root of all her idylls. She’d pay anything
they asked to get them published.</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> H’m! Did she tell you so?</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> My dear, of course not. But I happen
to&mdash;oh, do listen to this. I do think they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a><br /><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
draw the line somewhere. It wouldn’t be so bad
if they would keep it select. But really! <i>That</i>
woman!</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> Well, who is it?</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> Mrs. Judesheim! A whole paragraph
about her and her diamonds. <i>Her</i> diamonds!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Not the Bridge woman?</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> Positively, my dear, though one
would have thought after that last little <i>exposé</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Well, really! I wonder who they’ll
put in next!</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> Anyone, my dear Edith&mdash;anyone who’ll
pay. That’s the way it’s done. Susan wants to
dispose of her articles, and, accordin’ to you, she
pays, and in they go. Mrs. Whatshername has
got daughters and she wants to dispose of <i>them</i>.
So, she pays, and in <i>they</i> go. Quite simple, ain’t
it?</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> Oh, but I’m <i>sure</i> you are wrong.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I don’t think you <i>can</i> be right. We
haven’t come to <i>that</i> yet.</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> <i>You</i> haven’t, my dear, of course. You
buy the paper because you&mdash;have to read Susan’s
articles. Never do myself. Hate readin’ articles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a><br /><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
specially by people I know. But that’s just the
difference between you two and this Judesheim
woman. She <i>likes</i> to see her name in print. And
then, her husband’s a business man, and she knows
the value of a good advertisement.</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> I <i>can’t</i> believe it.</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> Well, we’ll ask Susan when she comes.
She knows all about it. She ought to be&mdash;ah, here
she is. How do, my dear?</p>

<p><i>Lady Susan Southwater</i> (<i>enters hurriedly</i>). You
dear people. I <i>am</i> so ashamed. I simply <i>had</i> to
finish my article for next week, and it wouldn’t
come.</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> We were just talking about your
articles. I particularly liked that last one in
to-day’s paper.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> So did I. But I think&mdash;no, I don’t
like it quite as well as the one <i>last</i> week. That
was too delightful. So witty.</p>

<p><i>Lady S.</i> Glad you liked it. Well, are we
going to cut for partners?</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> In a minute. But we want to ask you
about this old rag of yours. Do people pay to
have their names in it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lady S.</i> Tradespeople? <i>They</i> do, of course.</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> No, no. Ordinary people like us.</p>

<p><i>Lady S.</i> Oh, well&mdash;but what makes you ask?</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> Well, the fact is, Edith and I don’t
like the way they <i>will</i> put our names in, and we
were just saying that; and then to read a paragraph
about that Mrs. Judesheim actually, and
the whole thing seemed so vulgar, and we were
wondering whether anyone really did pay.</p>

<p><i>Lady S.</i> Oh, but my dear, of course they do,
though only the Editor knows who. But if you
like I’ll talk to him about you two, and say that
you would prefer not to have your names&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> Oh, please no, it <i>really</i> isn’t worth it.
No, as far as I am concerned personally&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> It seems to me it would be a pity
to make a fuss about it. After all, it doesn’t
do one any harm. So please don’t trouble,
darling.</p>

<p><i>Lady S.</i> My dear, it’s no trouble. I shall be
seeing him this evening, anyhow. So I’ll just tell
him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> I beg that you will do nothing of the
kind. I particularly dislike asking favours from
people of that class. Don’t you think we might
begin our rubber?</p>

<p><i>Lady S.</i> Perhaps that <i>would</i> be the best solution.
Unless you like to pay him <i>not</i> to put your names
in. You might do that, you know&mdash;for a change.</p>

<p><i>Lady A.</i> You don’t mean to imply&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady S.</i> My dear, not for worlds! Some
do, and some don’t. But of <i>course</i> you and
Edith&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>E. C.</i> Don’t! Let’s cut.</p>

<h3>THE GREAT KNEE-BREECHES
QUESTION</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>A Young Blood, in trouble about his legs, soliloquises before his
pier-glass</i>)</p>

<p>Well now, this <i>is</i> a doosid nuisance, what?&hellip;
S’pose I’ve got to face the question, now that all
the rest of our set have made up their minds.&hellip;
<i>Hate</i> havin’ to make up my mind! It’s rotten,
simply <i>rotten</i>&mdash;I don’t mean my mind, but havin’
to worry over things like this&mdash;I never was so
dreadfully worried, except perhaps over the shape
of that tie last season, what?&hellip; Why can’t they
put it off a little while longer? But no, they’re
all goin’ to wear them next Friday at that supper
at the Carlton, and Stella Pardedew’s comin’
too&mdash;wish I hadn’t asked her, she <i>can</i> be so cuttin’,
when she likes &hellip; I’m sure, if I’ve measured
myself once, I’ve measured myself fifty times, and
I can’t make ’em more than ten and three-eighths
round the calf.&hellip; I know she’ll ask whether it’s
three calves or one, when she sees me comin’
along &hellip; rotten joke, too!&hellip; Here, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>let me try
once more&mdash;where’s that tape?&hellip; No, I don’t
seem to spring to ten and a-half inches, anyhow,
and I walked the whole length of Bond Street this
afternoon, what?&hellip; They don’t look so bad in
gaiters and ridin’-breeches, or under a motor-coat,
and when I’m golfin’, too, I can double the thick
top ends of my stockin’s down and make quite a
decent show, but these silk things, what!&hellip;

<p><i>Hostess.</i> Yes, I think this is so much more
amusing than “Books,” and “Songs.” One gets
so tired of a lady with toy banners in her hair
calling herself “Under Two Flags,” and a man
insisting that he is perfectly made up for “The

<p><i>Hostess.</i> Perfectly delightful. So nice to have

<p><i>Second Lady Friend.</i> Well, my “Curiosity” is

pray don’t worry us with statistics. Now, what

dear lady, my little contribution to the general
hilarity of the occasion will be caused by my friend
in the bag. It is a specimen&mdash;a very rare specimen&mdash;of
the South African puff-adder. Most doctors
will tell you that the sting of this reptile is dangerous.
(<i>He produces from the bag a black, vicious-looking
snake.</i>) In fact, most people will say that
the sting, or rather a bite, is certain death. But be
reassured, my good friends. In spite of this universal
belief, I may say that, without expressing
an absolutely definite opinion, <i>I don’t think so</i>!</p>

<h3>THE LADIES’ COLUMN</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">About Town.</span></p>

<p>Several ladies have chosen this week for taking
walks. As I was popping down Bond Street a
few days ago I nearly ran into sweet Lady
B., who was dressed in the softest brown, with a
dear little robin redbreast perched lovingly in her
<i>toque</i>, which was a veritable <i>dernier cri</i>. There is
a beautiful story in connection with the little
dickey, as Lady B. believes that it is the same little
feathered darling she used to feed with crumbs on
her window-sill last winter! It is such a joy to
her tender heart to feel that her little pensioner
will now never be parted from his benefactress&mdash;while
the <i>toque</i> lasts.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, while I was returning the
Countess of A.’s bow, I caught my foot in the
<i>marabout</i> of one of our most unconventional and
witty American visitors, who is, by the way, the
heroine of the following delightful little story.
While staying at a country house, not a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
miles from a certain little white village with red
roofs, the house party was taken to a local flower
show. At dinner that evening, charming Miss X.,
who was a member of the party, was asked by
her partner if she took an interest in gardening.
“I guess I’m only interested in strawberry
leaves!” was the witty answer.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Books to Match all Dresses.</span></h3>

<p>All lovers of literature will be delighted to hear
that Miss Cumberland Smith’s latest work,
“Chained by Circumstance,” is to be issued in tooled
green leather to match the dainty little belts
which are being shown this week by Mr. Peter
Jay. This book would look particularly well with
a white satin Liberty <i>robe</i>, a stole of Indian work,
and the hair <i>coiffured</i> in the <i>mode retroussé</i>, which
is now, we are glad to see, once more with us.</p>

<p>Another little gem for book lovers is certainly
Lady M.’s wonderfully realistic “Revelations of
Revolt,” bound in crimson and black. No brunette
should be without it. To go with this beautiful
volume we should strongly recommend a simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>

<h3>FIVE O’CLOCK TEA-CLASSES</h3>

<p class="blockquote">CONVERSATIONAL TEAS twice a week OFFERED
by a Lady of high social position at her home to
strangers, Americans, Colonials and foreigners, for whom
pleasant introductions are desirable; private interviews
given to ladies who desire coaching on matters of high
English etiquette and fashion.&mdash;<i>Advertisement in morning
paper.</i></p>

<p>This seems to be a new variation. We all
know the blameless A.B.C. tea patronised by
country cousins after a hard day’s work shopping
or matinéeing in town.</p>

<p>There is the institution known as a “high tea”
(why <i>high</i>?) for those whose indigestion is robust
enough to negotiate six o’clock beef and tannin
from the pot.</p>

<p>A year or two ago we were deluged with
“book teas” and “play teas,” or “song teas,” and
other nursery devices for educating the middle-aged
and teaching the old idea how to make wild
shots at far-fetched rebuses.</p>

<p>For dipsomaniacs there is, we regret to say, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
D. T.; and the strict Q. T. for persons of a
secretive turn of mind.</p>

<p>And now a lady of high social position is in the
market with bi-weekly “Conversational Teas.” Is
the accent on the conversation or the tea, we
would ask? Are there any gratuities expected? Is
anything given away with a pot of tea? Do you
bring your own mug? Does the lady-autocrat at
the tea-table give marks for good behaviour? Does
she “turn” you if you have failed to learn your
small-talk correctly? Do you get a diploma (or a
degree) at the end of the course if you pass the
cake with honours? And is the “colonial” who
comes out at the bottom of the tea-class rewarded
with a wooden spoon? All these, and many
other questions, present themselves to would-be
students of “high English etiquette.”</p>
